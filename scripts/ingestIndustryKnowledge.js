      services: ["AI Texting", "SMS Revive", "Review Collector"],
      context: "Solar lead generation is expensive with Google Ads costing $50-150 per lead. Competition from national brands like SunRun and Tesla makes it harder for local installers."

      pain_point: "We're not following up with leads quickly enough",
      solution: "Solar buyers get multiple quotes within hours. Our AI responds to every lead in under 5 seconds, answers questions about panel types, savings calculations, tax credits, and installation timelines, then books qualified appointments while your competitors are still checking voicemail.",
      services: ["AI Voice Calls", "SMS Follow-Ups", "Appointment Bookings"],

      solution: "Our AI Voice system ensures you never miss another $30k solar opportunity. It answers calls 24/7, qualifies homeowners on roof ownership and credit, explains federal tax credits, and books consultations. If they can't talk, it automatically texts them to continue the conversation.",
      services: ["AI Voice Calls", "SMS Follow-Ups"],

      services: ["AI Voice Calls", "SMS Follow-Ups", "Appointment Bookings", "CRM Integration"],
      context: "60% of dental calls come outside business hours. Each new patient has a lifetime value of $10,000+. Missing calls directly impacts practice revenue."
